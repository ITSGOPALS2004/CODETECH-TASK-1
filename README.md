In this project, we aim to build a system capable of analyzing and classifying movie reviews based on the sentiment expressed in them. The goal is to automatically determine whether a review is positive, negative, or neutral. This task is a classic example of sentiment analysis, a common application in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that helps us understand the emotional tone behind a body of text.
